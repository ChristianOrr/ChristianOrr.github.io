I'm an aspiring data scientist with coding experience in Python, SQL and UNIX. I also have experience with MS Office tools, such as Exel, Powerpoint and Word. I am currently learning machine learning through Python. I have obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics, applied mathematics and physics from UKZN. I also have my Honours in pure mathematics from UCT.
